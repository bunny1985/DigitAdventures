Originally I have modified Cocos2dx library to support also keyboard ( for windows and linux), but currently this functionality is not present in source code .

Well in fact in tthis version I disabled also in App buying. 

If someone is interested in taking over this project I can help. Just contact me. Same thing if someone would like to publish this in AppStore.
